# **Project Overview**  
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis for ValueFrenzy, a large supermarket chain operating across the USA, Mexico, and Canada. The analysis focuses on sales data from 2021-2023, addressing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value (ATV).

# **Motivation**  
In the highly competitive FMCG industry, it is crucial to maintain strong profit margins while responding to shifting customer behaviors. This project aims to provide actionable insights that can help ValueFrenzy identify gaps and capitalize on opportunities to improve overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

# **Key KPIs**

## **Total Revenue**
Total revenue generated by ValueFrenzy across all regions and product categories.

## **Gross Profit**
Profit after deducting COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) from total revenue.

## **Quantity Sold**
Total units sold across all regions.

## **Total Transactions**
Number of customer transactions.

## **Average Transaction Value (ATV)**
Average amount spent per transaction.

# **Insights and Recommendations**

## **Insight 1:**

### *Declining Revenue and Gross Profit:*
1.	**Insight**: ValueFrenzy’s revenue dropped from $13.8M in 2021 to $9.7M in 2022 and 2023, alongside a decline in gross profit from $8.2M to $5.8M.  
2.	**Root Cause**: Reduced high-tier product sales, especially in the USA, due to economic constraints and lower ATV after Q4 2021.

## **Recommendation 1:**

### ***Address Declining Revenue and Gross Profit:***
1.	Focus on targeted promotions and pricing strategies for high-tier products, especially electronics and furniture, to revive sales in the USA.  
2.	Introduce flexible financing or installment plans to encourage purchases of higher-value items.  

## **Insight 2:**

### *Stable Quantity Sold but Shifting Product Mix:*
1.	**Insight**: 15.7M units sold, with groceries making up 60% of sales. High-tier product sales declined significantly.  
2.	**Root Cause**: Economic pressures led customers to prioritize essential goods like groceries, reducing demand for high-tier items.

## **Recommendation 2:**

### *Optimize Product Mix and Encourage High-Tier Sales:*  
1.	Shift marketing focus toward medium- and high-tier products in regions like Mexico and Canada, where potential for growth remains.
2.	Launch product bundles and cross-selling initiatives to increase spending on higher-margin categories.

## **Insight 3:**

### *High Transaction Volume but Lower Average Transaction Value:*
1.	**Insight**: Transaction volume remained steady, but ATV dropped from $75+ in 2021 to $53+ in 2022-2023.  
2.	**Root Cause**: Fewer high-value transactions and more frequent low-cost purchases caused the sharp drop in ATV.

## **Recommendation 3:**

### *Boost Average Transaction Value (ATV):*
1.	Implement loyalty programs and personalized discounts to increase the ATV, particularly for frequent customers.
2.	Encourage customers to add higher-value products to their carts through targeted upselling at checkout.

## **Insight 4:**

### *Regional Disparities in Performance:*
1.	**Insight**: USA saw the largest revenue drop, while Mexico and Canada showed better stability.  
2.	**Root Cause**: Economic challenges in the USA drove the steep decline in high-tier sales, while Mexico and Canada were less affected.

## **Recommendation 4:**

### *Improve Regional Performance with Tailored Strategies:*
1.	Develop region-specific marketing campaigns to address the unique needs of each market (USA, Mexico, and Canada).
2.	Invest in localized market research to better understand customer behavior and adapt product offerings accordingly.

## **Insight 5:**

### *Impact of Macroeconomic Conditions on Purchasing Patterns:*
1.	**Insight**: A significant drop in ATV, especially in the USA, indicated a shift toward lower-cost, essential goods.  
2.	**Root Cause**: Inflation and changing consumer behavior led to fewer purchases of high-value products like electronics.

## **Recommendation 5:**

### *Adapt to Macroeconomic Conditions:*
1.	Leverage ValueFrenzy’s private label brands to provide customers with affordable, high-quality alternatives.
2.	Enhance operational efficiency to mitigate rising costs and pass savings on to consumers through competitive pricing.

# **Data Sources**
The dataset used for this analysis was provided in CSV format, eliminating the need to use SQL for data retrieval. The data was imported directly into Excel for cleaning, transformation, and modeling.

# **Data Model**

The data model was created using Power Pivot to establish relationships between the fact table (sales data) and dimension tables (products, regions, and time). This data model is the backbone of the analysis and enabled complex calculations and dynamic insights.

![ValueFrenzy Data Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f95401f3-dde9-4cc9-a792-837262b9d0c0)
 
The fact and dimension tables are related in the following ways:
## ***Fact Table (Sales):***
Includes sales transaction data segmented by region, product category, and time.
## ***Dimension Tables:***
### *Products:* 
Categorizes products into low-tier (groceries), medium-tier (household goods), and high-tier (electronics).
### *Regions:* 
Lists USA, Mexico, and Canada.
### *Time:* 
Segments data by year, month, and quarter for trend analysis.

2.	Deeper Analysis: Further segment the data by product categories, customer demographics, and geographic micro-markets to gain more granular insights.

3.	Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning models to forecast future sales trends, customer behavior, and revenue potential.

# **Lessons Learned**
Working on the ValueFrenzy data analysis project has been an invaluable experience, offering insights from various perspectives—technical, analytical, and strategic:

## ***1. Data Preparation and Cleaning:***
One of the key lessons was the importance of robust data cleaning and transformation. Handling messy, incomplete, and unstructured data required a deep dive into Power Query, which helped automate much of the cleaning process. I gained valuable experience in understanding the nuances of data quality issues and how to resolve them effectively.

## ***2. Working with Real-World Business Data:***
I learned how real-world datasets often don’t conform to neat, predefined structures. The data required not only cleaning but also thoughtful segmentation, such as breaking down information by product tiers and regions. Understanding the business logic behind the data was critical in making the right transformations and interpreting the results correctly.

## ***3. Defining Key Metrics and KPIs:***
Identifying the right KPIs—Total Revenue, Gross Profit, Quantity Sold, Total Transactions, and Average Transaction Value—taught me the importance of aligning analytical goals with business objectives. These KPIs formed the backbone of the analysis, and I learned how essential it is to communicate their impact clearly to stakeholders.
## ***4. Data Modeling in Power Pivot:***
Setting up relationships between fact and dimension tables was a key learning area. Understanding how to structure data models for efficient querying and analysis helped me enhance my skills in Power Pivot and reinforced the importance of having well-defined data relationships.
## ***5. Dashboard Design and Presentation:***
Crafting a dashboard that is both insightful and user-friendly was a rewarding challenge. I learned the importance of balancing aesthetics and functionality, ensuring that key insights were easily accessible while maintaining a clean and professional design. This project helped me hone my skills in visual storytelling and presenting complex insights in a simplified, impactful way.
## ***6. Stakeholder Collaboration and Feedback:***
Frequent iterations and feedback loops with hypothetical stakeholders like Sarah (COO) gave me an understanding of the dynamic nature of data analytics projects. I learned how to adjust my analysis and recommendations based on feedback and how to present findings that resonate with a C-level audience.
## ***7. Time Management and Agile Approach:***
Managing the project timeline taught me to work in sprints and deliver results iteratively. Each phase of the project, from data collection to final presentation, required effective time management and prioritization of tasks. This experience highlighted the need for flexibility and adaptability in the face of evolving requirements.

Overall, this project was a comprehensive learning experience, covering everything from technical data handling to strategic business analysis and communication. It has prepared me well for future data analysis projects where technical skills, business understanding, and stakeholder engagement all converge.
